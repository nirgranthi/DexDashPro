## What is this?

**DexDash** is built to be a fast, no-nonsense way to check crypto charts and liquidity data without navigating through heavy exchange interfaces. It runs entirely in the browser—no backend server or API keys required.

## Features ✨

* **Real-time Data:** Fetches live price, liquidity, FDV, and volume directly from DexScreener.

* **Live Charts:** Embeds the native DexScreener trading view chart (fully responsive on mobile).

* **Smart Search:** Includes an autocomplete dropdown for popular tokens (SOL, PEPE, WIF, etc.) and supports searching by contract address.

* **Mobile Optimized:** The chart automatically adjusts aspect ratios for phone screens so it doesn't look squashed.
